# TCH-CMP

## The code used in my paper(Uncertainty Analysis and Consistency Assessment of Evaporation Data in the Greater Mekong Subregion -- Journal Of Hydrometeorology Under Review) is made public here, hoping to save time for others in their research and studies.

*The Three Corner Hat (TCH) method, proposed by Tavella and Premoli (1993).*

*Comparison of Map Profile (CMP) method was proposed by Gaucherel et al. (2007) to quantify the magnitude and distribution area of differences between image data.*
